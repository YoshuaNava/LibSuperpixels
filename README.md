# LibSuperpixels
C++ library designed to handle superpixels information, using OpenCV.


Authors:
	Yoshua Nava
	Rafael Colmenares

## Instructions to compile and run the code:

1. Open a terminal and to the the repository root directory ("slic_egbis_segmentation/").

2. Type the following commands to compile everything:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

3. To run the EGBIS superpixel segmentation test, type:

./test_egbis_superpixel_segmentation


4. To run the EGBIS superpixel segmentation test, type:

./test_slic_superpixel_segmentation


5. To run the superpixel histogram comparison test, type:

./test_histogram_superpixel_comparison


If you want to change the algorithm that is used for generating and comparing superpixels, change the value of the constant SUPERPIXEL_ALGORITHM (line 18) for either "EGBIS" or "SLIC"



## Contributions:

A library for handling superpixels called "libsuperpixel", that can be found in the folder include/libsuperpixel.

A wrapper for the egbis algorithm, which can be found in include/egbis, and is mainly concentrated in the files egbis.cpp and egbis.h.

A modification of the default SLIC library files, so that they can be compliant with libsuperpixel.
